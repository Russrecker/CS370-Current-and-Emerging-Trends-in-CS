# CS370-Current-and-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
We were given most of the code already in TreasureMaze.py, GameExperience.py, and TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. The main part I created was the Q-learning training in TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. This was where the agent learned how to explore the maze. I followed the pseudocode instructions and wrote the code that let the pirate explore the maze, pick random moves at first, and then slowly learn to pick the best actions to where it finally learned to get to the trasure in the most optimal way.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
They build tools that help people solve problems. Computer scientists design systems, write code, and use data to make things work better. Their work matters because technology is part of almost everything now, and it is important to make sure it is used in ways that actually help people and make a positive difference.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by breaking the problem into smaller steps. For this project, I looked at what the code already did and what I needed to add. I focused on one part at a time and tested and optimized the code until the pirate agent was able to get to the treasure the fastest way.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsibility is to make sure what I create is safe to use and not harmful to users. I need to protect user data and think about how my code affects people. Itâ€™s important to make sure whatever I create helps more than it harms.
